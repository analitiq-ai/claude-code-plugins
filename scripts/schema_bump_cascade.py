"""The model cascade that decides the semver bump a schema change requires.

Stage 1 (Jev) classifies the diff; a confidence below `CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`, or a
diff too large for Jev, escalates to stage 2 (Luna), which also reads both
whole schemas.
Any other failure stops classification with an exception: there is no fallback
severity.

The model pins, the floor and every prompt text are stated here once; the
evaluation (`scripts/eval_schema_bumps.py`) grades them, and changing any of
them means re-running it.
